DESCRIPTION:Governments post reports and data about their operations. Jou
 rnalists publish documents from whistleblowers. But there is a third typ
 e of open data that is often overlooked- the information people and comp
 anies post about themselves. People need jobs. Companies need to hire pe
 ople. Secret prisons do not build themselves.  \n\nBy making it feasible
  for anyone to collect public data online in bulk and exploring ways to 
 effectively use this data for concrete objectives\, we can build an inde
 pendent\, distributed system of accountability.
