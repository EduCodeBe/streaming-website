DESCRIPTION:Newly adopted VoLTE requires changes in all associated partie
 s\, such as 3GPP standard\, device\, operating system\, and cellular cor
 e networks. Therefore\, it is not too surprising that it has security pr
 oblems. However\, it turns out that it has way too many problems. In thi
 s talk\, we introduce how you can freely send data in the cellular netwo
 rk\, and how an attacker can perform caller spoofing and denial of servi
 ce attacks on calls to disable the targetâ€™s calling. Furthermore\, we ex
 plain how small implementation glitch on VoLTE may lead to break the who
 le cellular network down.
