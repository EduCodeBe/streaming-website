DESCRIPTION:Gradually we are all becoming more and more dependent on mach
 ines\, we will be able to live longer with an increased quality of life 
 due to machines integrated into our body. However\, our dependence on te
 chnology grows faster than our ability to secure it\, and a security fai
 lure of a medical device can have fatal consequences. This talk is about
  Marie's personal experience with being the host of a vulnerable medical
  implant\, and how this has forced her to become a human part of the "In
 ternet-of-Things".
