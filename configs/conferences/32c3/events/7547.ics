DESCRIPTION:In 2010 I was asked by the second maintainer in a row to take
  over as new maintainer of the libusb project. The first time I had decl
 ined.\n\nThe second time I accepted\, and sadly failed.\n\nEventually a 
 hostile fork emerged\, with the explicit goal to take over the original 
 project.\n\nI will tell you my story\, which mistakes I made and what I 
 learned - about independent and corporate contributors in open source pr
 ojects\, about package maintainers in downstream OS distributions\, abou
 t trolls on the internet\, about GitHub Inc. and about myself.\n\nThe ho
 stile fork? It wasn't merged.
