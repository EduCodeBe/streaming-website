DESCRIPTION:What does the fact that Tor users can’t edit wikipedia mean f
 or the quality of the ``encyclopedia that anyone can edit?’’ How do capt
 chas and blocking of anonymity services affect the experiences of Tor us
 ers when they are trying to contribute content? This talk will discuss t
 he increasing limitations of active participation in the anonymous Inter
 net and the findings of our interview study of Tor users and wikipedia e
 ditors concerning these issues.  We believe that by understanding the co
 ntributions Tor users make—and that people denied access to anonymity to
 ols don't make—we can help make the case for the value of anonymity onli
 ne.
