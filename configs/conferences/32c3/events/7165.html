<p class="abstract">This talk is about Vehicle2Vehicle (V2V) communication in Europe and in the U.S. Next to the introduction of some requirements for V2V communication, the basic approaches of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p are presented. This includes an introduction to communication stack, concepts of message dissemination, message contents, privacy &amp; security issues and an outlook to further developments.</p>
<p class="description">Modern vehicles have several advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs). This is the beginning of the full automation of the driving task. Vehicle manufacturers already showed first fully automated prototypes but a lot of challenges have to be addressed until such systems will be commercially available. One challenge is to provide the necessary information for the self-driving vehicle to make the right driving decisions. V2V communication is one possible technology to provide this information. The proposed talk is an introduction to the state of the art of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p.</p>

<p class="description">This talk is a technical introduction to Vehicle2Vehicle communication. It will introduce the basic concepts of V2V technology and provides references to documents of the standardization. The talk will consist of the following parts:</p>

<p class="description">Motivation:
<br>The talk starts by describing the scope and possible applications of V2V communication focusing on the use-case of the “Electronic Emergency Break Light”. What is more, V2V communication will be compared to traditional on-board sensors like Lidar or Radar.</p>

<p class="description">Basic concepts:
<br>The state of the art concepts of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p and its differences compared to consumer WiFi will be discussed in this section. Furthermore, the existing concepts and standards developed in both Europe and the U.S. will be compared, with a special focus on the differences between the two approaches. In summary, the following questions will be addressed:
<br>•	What are the approaches for V2V communication in Europe and the U.S.?  
<br>•	How is communication realized for V2V?
<br>•	Which standardization approaches exist and where can they be found?
<br>•	What are the most important disseminated information and messages?
<br>•	How are these messages formatted? (header structure)
<br>•	What are the differences between the V2V communication concepts in the U.S and Europe ?
<br>•	Which technical challenges have to be solved?</p>

<p class="description">Privacy and Security:
<br>As V2V communication will be used to broadcast the vehicle’s position and dynamic state, the privacy of the driver has to be protected. The talk will introduce the pursued concepts for privacy protection, whilst ensuring that only authorized entities are able participate in the communication. Due to the complexity of the topic, this section will focus on the concepts and the standards found in Europe.</p>

<p class="description">Perspective:
<br>Eventually, the talk will address future work within the field of V2V communication, such as novel ADASs and privacy concepts.</p>

<p class="description">Remarks: The talk is only about the state of the art of V2V technology, its standardization and its further development.
