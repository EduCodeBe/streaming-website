DESCRIPTION:Physical keys and locks are one of the oldest security mechan
 isms still employed\ntoday. In this talk\, we will discuss how 3D printi
 ng keys enable attacks against many modern lock systems. We will describ
 e projects researchers and hobbyists have done involving 3D printed keys
 \, and present our own research on automating several of these attacks i
 n order to demonstrate how easy they are to do. Ultimately\, we hope to 
 describe the current state of 3D printed keys\, and their impact on the 
 physical security systems we most often take for granted.
