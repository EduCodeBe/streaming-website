DESCRIPTION:Hacking receives growing attention among social scientists du
 ring the last five years. Researchers particularly in the fields of Huma
 n-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (
 CSCW) but also in the social sciences generally have begun to study hack
 ing empirically—investigating hacking as a practice and as cultural phen
 omenon. The talk offers a glimpse of the spectrum of research about hack
 ing in HCI\, CSCW\, and adjacent fields. Researchers in these fields por
 tray hacking very differently. The spectrum ranges from “transgressive c
 raft” to “innovative leisure practice\,” from skilled craftsmanship to a
 d hoc kludging\, from an individualist pursuit to a community mission\, 
 from an expression of liberalism to an exclusive practice of cultural di
 stinction. Some researchers see hacking as an illustration of how to def
 y technological determinism\, i.e.\, the conviction that the technologic
 al determines the social\, a position that social scientists typically f
 ight ferociously. Other researchers see it as the future of “end-user in
 novation.” This talks discusses these notions and describes the value---
 economic\, pedagogical\, cultural\, conceptual---that different research
  perspectives perceive in hacking.
