DESCRIPTION:The Ecuadorian government received international visibility w
 hen in 2012 it agreed to grant Wikileaks founder Julian Assange politica
 l asylum and host him in Ecuador's London embassy. Ecuador has since bee
 n widely praised for standing up to the United States to defend the free
 dom of the press and freedom of expression.\n\nHowever\, the reality is 
 not consistent with this image Ecuador seeks to project. Journalists ins
 ide the country face oppressive laws\, huge fines and lawsuits for repor
 ting on government corruption. Digital and physical surveillance of jour
 nalists and activists is in fact getting worse.\n\nWe will analyze some 
 of the existing leaks that prove such activities. We will also give a fi
 rst-hand account from someone who had to literally run away from Ecuador
  for publishing leaked materials proving illegal espionage against journ
 alists and citizens.\n\nIs Ecuador really interested in free speech? We 
 don't think so and we will tell you why.
