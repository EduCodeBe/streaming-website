DESCRIPTION:The talk „We Lost The War“ was presented at Congress ten year
 s ago\, causing quite a stir. It was a prediction of a dark future that 
 did not sit well with many people\, but unfortunately many predictions h
 ave come true meanwhile. This talk will try to address what comes next\,
  as well as what the hacker community can do to make things better.
