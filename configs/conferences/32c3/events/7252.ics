DESCRIPTION:    Embedded systems are omnipresent in our everyday life and
  are becoming \n    increasingly present in many computing and networked
  environments. For example\,\n    they are at the core of various Common
 -Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices such as\n    printers\, video surveillance
  systems\, home routers and virtually anything we \n    informally call 
 electronics. The emerging phenomenon of the Internet-of-Things\n    (IoT
 ) will make them even more widespread and interconnected. Cisco famously
 \n    predicted that there will be 50 billion connected embedded devices
  by 2020.\n    Given those estimations\, the heterogeneity of technology
  and application fields\,\n    and the current threat landscape\, the se
 curity of all those devices becomes of\n    paramount importance. In add
 ition to this\, manual security analysis does not\n    scale. Therefore\
 , novel\, scalable and automated approaches are needed.\n    In this tal
 k\, we present several methods that make *the large scale\n    security 
 analyses of embedded devices* a feasible task. We implemented \n    thos
 e techniques in a scalable framework that we tested on real world data. 
 \n    First\, we collected a large number of firmware images from Intern
 et \n    repositories and then performed simple static analysis. \n    S
 econd\, since embedded devices often expose web interfaces for \n    rem
 ote administration\, therefore we developed techniques for large scale \
 n    static and dynamic analysis of such interfaces. \n    Finally\, ide
 ntifying and classifying the firmware files\, as well as \n    fingerpri
 nting and identifying embedded devices is difficult\, especially \n    a
 t large scale. \n    Using these techniques\, we were able to discover a
  large number of new \n    vulnerabilities in dozens of firmware package
 s\, affecting a great variety of vendors and\n    device classes. We wer
 e also able to achieve high accuracy in fingerprinting and\n    classifi
 cation of both firmware images and live devices.
