DESCRIPTION:In the dark days of October 2014 an unprecedented Ebola epide
 mic wrecked havoc across Sierra Leone\, Liberia and Guinea. In Sierra Le
 one\, the health system was only weeks away from total collapse due to a
 n inability to manage or pay health workers across the country and the w
 orld braced for the unchecked spread of the disease throughout west Afri
 ca. In the face of apocalyptic scenario\, a company made up of local hac
 kers took on the unprecedented challenge of building\, implementing and 
 running a huge Management Information System and Mobile payments system 
 to keep the health system from collapsing. This talk will show how this 
 was achieved with Open Source Software\, second hand laptops\, hacked vo
 ter registration machines\, second hand smartphones and some very smart 
 and determined young people used to achieving great things with none of 
 the resources we take for granted. We salute them.\n
