DESCRIPTION:Is your email being sent in the clear? While PGP and S/MIME p
 rovide end-to-end encrypted mail\, most users have yet to adopt these pr
 actices\, and for users who have\, these tools leave metadata\, such as 
 the subject\, sender\, and recipient\, visible everywhere along a messag
 e’s path. SMTP&mdash\;the ubiquitous mail transport protocol&mdash\;has 
 evolved over the years to add encryption and authentication\, both of wh
 ich take place behind the scenes and help guard against surveillance and
  spam. While these features are being increasingly deployed\, our resear
 ch shows that they are almost always configured in vulnerable ways&mdash
 \;the details of which are hidden from the users sending and receiving m
 ail. Even more disturbingly\, these vulnerabilities are being widely exp
 loited in the wild: in seven countries\, more than 20% of inbound Gmail 
 messages are downgraded to cleartext by network-based attacks. In the mo
 st severe case\, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgrad
 ed to cleartext. In this talk\, I’ll introduce the commonly used SMTP se
 curity extensions&mdash\;including STARTTLS\, SPF\, DKIM\, and DMARC&mda
 sh\;and describe the current state of mail security on the Internet. I'l
 l describe several commonly occurring attacks our recent research has fo
 und and discuss how mail operators can configure their servers to secure
  email transport. Finally\, I'll discuss several weaknesses in the proto
 cols we're using and recent proposals for helping secure email transport
 .
