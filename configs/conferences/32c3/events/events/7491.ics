DESCRIPTION:Last year I presented research showing how to de-anonymize pr
 ogrammers based on their coding style. This is of immediate concern to o
 pen source software developers who would like to remain anonymous. On th
 e other hand\, being able to de-anonymize programmers can help in forens
 ic investigations\, or in resolving plagiarism claims or copyright dispu
 tes. \n\nI will report on our new research findings in the past year. We
  were able to increase the scale and accuracy of our methods dramaticall
 y and can now handle 1\,600 programmers\, reaching 94% de-anonymization 
 accuracy. In ongoing research\, we are tackling the much harder problem 
 of de-anonymizing programmers from binaries of compiled code. This can h
 elp identify the author of a suspicious executable file and can potentia
 lly aid malware forensics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques
  using a dataset collected from GitHub.
