DESCRIPTION:Yearly\, the world is inundated with news about government da
 ta collection programs. In addition to these programs\, governments coll
 ect data from third party sources to gather information about individual
 s.  This data in conjunction with machine learning aids governments in d
 etermining where crime will be committed and who has committed a crime. 
 Could this data serve as a method by which governments predict whether o
 r not the individual will commit a crime? This talk will examine the use
  of big data in the context of predictive policing. Specifically\, how d
 oes the data collected inform suspicion about a particular individual? I
 n the context of U.S. law\, can big data alone establish reasonable susp
 icion or should it just factor into the totality of the circumstances? H
 ow do we mitigate the biases that might exist in large data sets?
