DESCRIPTION:Yosys (Yosys Open Synthesis Suite) is an Open Source Verilog 
 synthesis and verification tool.\n\nProject IceStorm aims at reverse eng
 ineering and documenting  the bit-stream format of Lattice iCE40 FPGAs a
 nd providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bit-stream files\, 
 including a tool that converts iCE40 bit-stream files into behavioral Ve
 rilog. Currently the bitstream format for iCE40 HX1K and HX8K is fully d
 ocumented and supported by the tools.  \n\nArachne-PNR is an Open Source
  place&route tool for iCE40 FPGAs based on the databases provided by Pro
 ject IceStorm. It converts BLIF files into an ASCII file format that can
  be turned into a bit-stream by IceStorm tools.\n\nThis three projects t
 ogether implement a complete open source tool-chain for iCE40 FPGAs. It 
 is available now and it is feature complete (with the exception of timin
 g analysis\, which is work in progress).
