DESCRIPTION:"Signal level is high but throughput is low" is a common expe
 rience in WLAN networks without central management. That causes a lot of
  frustration\, mainly because there is no easy way for users to OBSERVE 
 the presence of interference at all. \n\nIn order to improve this situat
 ion we developed a patch for OpenWRT which makes interference from other
  sources visible and is able to display the current utilization-ratio (c
 hannel load). No additional hardware is required and no interruption of 
 normal operation is necessary - because recent chipsets maintain interna
 l counters for channel load tracking.
