DESCRIPTION:In the last couple of years\, cloud and web services have bec
 ome more and more popular. Since Snowden we know for sure that intellige
 nce agencies have access to the data storage of an  service provider\, e
 ither by (forced) cooperation\, or espionage. Thus\, to protect our priv
 acy we have to encrypted our data before hand it over to our service pro
 vider (data holder). But this approach contradicts the very idea of a we
 b service where the data holder have to process our data in one way or a
 n other. Therefore\, we need new cryptographic techniques to enable the 
  data holder to perform operation on encrypted data. One of the most imp
 ortant operations for cloud storage or database based web/cloud  service
 s is the search operation.  In this talk we focus on the very familiar c
 loud storage scenario. Because in this scenario\, It is obvious\, that t
 he user (data owner) do not want to perform the search by himself. This 
 should be a service offered by the data holder. We will present differen
 t practical approaches to achieve searchable ciphertext\, namely one wit
 h an index and one with cleverly encrypted words.\n\nNote that no PhD is
  required to attend this talk \;-)
