DESCRIPTION:This talk will focus on the potential ability of data disaggr
 egated by race and ethnicity to reduce discriminatory policing in German
 y.  In the UK\, data has been collected during police procedures\, allow
 ing for a monitoring and evaluation of discriminatory policing practices
 . Unfortunately\, such an empirically driven policy approach is not curr
 ently possible in Germany. This talk will argue that\, as a first step\,
  a policy based off the UK approach towards data collection be implement
 ed in Germany to incorporate\, rather than ignore\, Germanyâ€™s diverse id
 entities\, and to allow for empirically driven and more effective polici
 ng.
