DESCRIPTION:CubeSat are small standardized satellites typically flown as 
 secondary and containerized payloads piggybacking on the launches of lar
 ger satellites. Their low entrance cost have been a revolution in openin
 g access to space for a broad range of institutions. In this talk the ba
 sics of CubeSat standards\, technology and development are going to be p
 resented. The goal is to proliferate the knowledge of what it takes to s
 uccessfully build\, launch and operate a CubeSat within and beyond the h
 acker community.
