DESCRIPTION:In 2011\, Joanna Rutkowska unveiled an easy-to-use tool for m
 itigating many attacks on system boot chains by using the TPM - the Anti
  Evil Maid. Unfortunately the implementation was difficult to incorporat
 e into normal system boot in a secure manner - anybody able to observe a
  user could recreate the secret. This presentation describes a method to
  allow systems to prove their identity to the user without making it tri
 vial for attackers to mimic a secure boot and extract secrets from the u
 ser\, and why the state of modern hardware means this may still not be e
 nough.
