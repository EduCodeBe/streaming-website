DESCRIPTION:Since my move to China in 2012 I have actively engaged in the
  local art scenes of Beijing and Shanghai\, focusing on collaborating wi
 th artists interested in technology and the internet. My own personal in
 dependent research of the Chinese internet and the popular Chinese socia
 l app\, WeChat 微信\, has contributed to an ongoing massive archive I bega
 n in 2014 called The Chinternet Archive. To date\, I have over 15\,000 p
 ieces of content (and growing) documenting localized trends\, memes\, ve
 rnacular photography\, online personas\, .gif animations\, videos\, self
 ies\, propaganda\, retail\, family/work life\, and other such digital ar
 tifacts of online Chinese culture. This archive directly influenced my a
 rtistic and curatorial practice\, resulting in an online art collection 
 called Netize.net\, or its Chinese name of 网友网 [wǎngyǒuwǎng] “Internet F
 riend Network”\, which collaborates with emerging Chinese and internatio
 nal artists who are exploring or deconstructing East/West dichotomies\, 
 engaging in Sino-centric Web aesthetics\, or investigating the East onli
 ne. The goal of this talk is to explore through my Chinternet Archive an
 d Netize.net collections\, forms of creativity found in China in relatio
 nship to it’s early internet history\, interactions with technology\, lo
 calized networks and restrictions.
