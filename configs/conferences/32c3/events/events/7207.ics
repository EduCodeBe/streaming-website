DESCRIPTION:News reports and political speeches are currently replete wit
 h references to hacking and hacktivism\, i.e.\, politically motivated ha
 cking. They often portray hackers and hacktivists negatively and put the
 m onto the same level with\, for example\, terrorists. This talk is base
 d on a PhD research project examining the perception of self-identified 
 hackers and hacktivists on these (in)securitising developments. It inves
 tigates how hackers and hacktivists understand themselves and their acti
 vities\, explores how they articulate the effects of this (in)securitisa
 tion\, and outlines the ways they resist these processes.
