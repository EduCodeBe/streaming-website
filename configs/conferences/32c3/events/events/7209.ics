DESCRIPTION:In the past years there has been a lot of discussion on the t
 opic of state sponsored surveillance. But hardly any material can be acc
 essed to support the general debate due to vaguely declared security con
 cerns. So we are debating Big Brother with little knowledge about what h
 e actually sees\, while he is watching. Over the course of three years\,
  I was able to research the archives left by East Germany's Stasi to loo
 k for visual memories of this notorious surveillance system and more rec
 ently I was invited to spend some weeks looking at the archive by the Cz
 echoslovak StB. Illustrating with images I have found during my research
 \, I would like to address the question why this material is still relev
 ant â€“ even 25 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain.
