DESCRIPTION:There are two lines of research in the world about decreasing
  poverty in low-income communities: (1) to create solutions and share th
 em with people living in low-income areas or (2) build the capacity of p
 eople from low-income areas to create their own solutions. Maker Spaces 
 to BoP have showed great results to the strategy two. The lecture has th
 e goal to expose all the experience we have learnt in the last three yea
 rs to project\, implement and manage a Maker Space in a favela in São Pa
 ulo - Brazil called Innovation Center Vila Nova Esperança (ICVNE).
