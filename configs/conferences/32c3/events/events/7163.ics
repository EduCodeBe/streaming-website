DESCRIPTION:Memory corruption is an ongoing problem and in past years we 
 have both developed a set of defense mechanisms and novel attacks agains
 t those defense mechanisms. Novel defense mechanisms like Control-Flow I
 ntegrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) promise to stop control-
 flow hijack attacks. We show that\, while they make attacks harder\, att
 acks often remain possible. Introducing novel attack mechanisms\, like C
 ontrol-Flow Bending (CFB)\, we discuss limitations of the current approa
 ches. CFB is a generalization of data-only attacks that allows an attack
 er to execute code even if a defense mechanism significantly constrains 
 execution.
