DESCRIPTION:FOSS and hacker culture meeting the EU buereaucracy.  What ca
 n possibly come out of that?  We'll discuss what is involved for FOSS pr
 ojects and other interested parties to get $$$ funding by the European U
 nion.  Hackers deal with rule systems and their execution.  And the Euro
 pean Union issues a lot of rules which are executed by the "commission" 
 and its employees.  Within the Horizon2020 framework programme 80.000.00
 0.000 Euros will be distributed towards research projects across Europe 
 between 2014-2020.  Shouldn't some of that money go to purposes deemed u
 seful by 32c3 attendants?\n
