DESCRIPTION:As Internet users increasingly connect to the Internet throug
 h smartphones\, this has transformed Iran’s Internet ecology towards an 
 increasing reliance and production in apps. In Iran\, a country that pra
 ctises some of the most stringent censorship and surveillance techniques
  in the world has seen this transformation reshape the way the governmen
 t implements information controls online. While applications with popula
 r usage on browsers such as Facebook and Twitter remain blocked through 
 their mobile applications\, platforms that predominantly exist in app fo
 rm such as WhatsApp\, Viber\, and Instagram remain unblocked in the coun
 try. This talk will look at how the government is counteracting these po
 licies through various means\, including local imitation apps\, and new 
 programs such as ‘intelligent filtering’\, and the Revolutionary Guards'
  “Spider” program. Additionally\, a discussion of how Iranian Internet u
 sers use these platforms\, especially in reference to digital security a
 wareness and practices will be included.
