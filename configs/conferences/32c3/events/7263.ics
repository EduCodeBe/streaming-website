DESCRIPTION:On 17th December 2014\, the Government of India's Ministry of
  Communications and Information Technology issued an order to all licens
 ed Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the country to block access to 3
 2 websites\, effective immediately. The basis of this was a claim that t
 he targeted web services were being used for "Jihadi Propaganda" by "Ant
 i-National groups". As a response to this\, a few technologists in Berli
 n got together and thought it would be a good idea to do some research u
 sing free and accessible tools and to look at how censorship has been im
 plemented\, as well as the various techniques that could be used to circ
 umvent this censorship. This talk will discuss our findings and make rec
 ommendations about how ISPs can handle such censorship requests better\,
  while being fair and transparent to their customers.
