DESCRIPTION:For years SCADA StrangeLove team speaks about vulnerabilities
  in Industrial Control Systems. Now we want to show by example of railwa
 y the link between information security and industrial safety and demons
 trate how a root access gained in a few minutes can bring to naught all 
 the years of efforts that were devoted to the improvement of fail-safety
  and reliability of the ICS system.\n\nRailroads is a complex systems an
 d process automation is used in different areas: to control power\, swit
 ches\, signals and locomotives. At this talk we will analyze threats and
  vulnerabilities of fundamental rail-road automation systems such as com
 puter based interlocking\, automatic train control and automatic train p
 rotection. \n\nNo vendor names and vulnerabilities details will be relea
 sed\, for obvious reasons. By the way\, all research based on hands-on s
 ecurity exercises and most of issues are confirmed and processed by vend
 ors.
